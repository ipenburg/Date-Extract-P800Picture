=head1 NAME

Date::Extract::P800Picture - class for extracting the date and the hour from
the filename of pictures taken with a Sony Ericsson P800 camera phone.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Date::Extract::P800Picture version 0.104.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Date::Extract::P800Picture;

    $filename = "8B360001.JPG"; # 2008-12-04T6:00:00

    $parser = new Date::Extract::P800Picture();
    $parser = new Date::Extract::P800Picture('filename' => $filename);

    $datetime = $parser->extract();
    $datetime = $parser->extract($filename);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Sony Ericsson P800 camera phone stores pictures taken with the camera on
the device with a filename consisting of the date and the hour the picture was
taken, followed by a four digit number and the .JPG extension. The format of
the date and the hour is YMDH, in which the single characters are base 36 to
fit a range of about 36 years, 12 months, 31 days and 24 hours since the year
2000 in a case insensitive US-ASCII representation.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=over 4

=item Date::Extract::P800Picture-E<gt>new()

=item Date::Extract::P800Picture-E<gt>new('filename' => $filename)

Constructs a new Date::Extract::P800Picture object.

=item $parser->filename($filename);

Sets the filename to extract the date and hour from.

=item $obj-E<gt>extract()

Extract date and hour from the string and returns it as L<DateTime|DateTime>
object. Returns undef if no valid date could be extracted.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

No configuration and environment settings are used.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over 4

=item * perl 5.14 

=item * L<POSIX|POSIX>

=item * L<English|English>

=item * L<DateTime|DateTime>

=item * L<Readonly|Readonly>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=over 4

=item * To avoid ambiguity between more common date notations and the
Sony Ericsson P800's date notation this is a separate module. It's highly
unlikely that in any other setting "2000" means the first of January 2002.

=item * For perls earlier than 5.14 version 0.04 of this module provides the
same functionality in a perl 5.6 compatible way.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

An exception in the form of an L<Exception::Class|Exception::Class> named
C<DateExtractP800PictureException> is thrown when a date can't be extracted
from the string:

=over 4

=item * Could not parse year char '%s'

=item * Could not parse month char '%s'

=item * Could not parse day char '%s'

=item * Could not parse hour char '%s'

=item * No date found in filename '%s'

=item * Filename is not set, nothing to extract

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item * Usually the files are transferred from the P800 to other systems in a
way that hasn't completely preserved the timestamp of the file, so there is no
reliable way to double check the results by comparing the date extracted from
the filename with the timestamp of the file.

=item * There are no error values to provide different exit statuses for
different failure reasons
